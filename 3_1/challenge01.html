        <h1>Who Said It Was Simple</h1>
        <h3>A poem by Audre Lorde</h3>

        <p>There are so many roots to the tree of anger <br>
        that sometimes the branches shatter <br>
        before they bear.<br>
        <br>
        Sitting in Nedicks <br>
        the women rally before they march <br>
        discussing the problematic girls <br>
        An almost white counterman passes <br>
        a waiting brother to serve them first <br>  
        and the ladies neither notice nor reject <br> 
        the slighter pleasures of their slavery. <br>
        But I who am bound by my mirror <br>
        as well as my bed <br>
        see causes in colour <br>
        as well as sex <br>
        <br>
        and sit here wondering <br>
        which me will survive <br>
        all these liberations.</p>
